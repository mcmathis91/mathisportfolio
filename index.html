    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Mike Mathis and I am a husband and a father. I am also a student within the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. I am taking this course as I am looking to make a career change and I find this industry to be wildly interesting, growing rapidly, and I love being able to create something from scratch. When I am not with family, at work, or in class; you can find me outdoors in the mountains of western North Carolina. I was born and raised here, and this will always be "home" to me.
        </p>
